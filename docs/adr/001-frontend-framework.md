# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a frontend framework for building a modern, responsive self-storage website with the following requirements:
- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- Static site generation capabilities
- Modern React ecosystem
- TypeScript support
- Performance optimization features
- Easy deployment and hosting options

## Decision
We will use **Next.js 15.5.4** with the App Router as our frontend framework.

### Key Dependencies:
- `next@15.5.4` - React framework with SSR/SSG capabilities
- `react@18.3.1` - UI library
- `react-dom@18.3.1` - React DOM bindings
- `typescript@5.6.3` - Type safety and developer experience

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Create React App (CRA)** - Rejected due to lack of SSR and being deprecated
2. **Vite + React** - Good performance but requires additional SSR setup
3. **Gatsby** - Good for static sites but overkill for our use case
4. **Remix** - Modern but smaller ecosystem and learning curve

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Excellent SEO with server-side rendering
- Built-in performance optimizations (image optimization, code splitting)
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Easy deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or containerized environments
- App Router provides modern routing patterns

### Negative:
- Learning curve for App Router (newer paradigm)
- Vendor lock-in to Next.js patterns
- Bundle size can be larger than minimal React setups
- Some complexity in configuration for advanced use cases

### Technical Impact:
- Enables static generation for marketing pages
- Provides API routes for backend functionality
- Supports incremental static regeneration
- Built-in image optimization reduces bandwidth
- Automatic code splitting improves performance
