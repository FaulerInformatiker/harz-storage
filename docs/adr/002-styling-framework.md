# ADR-002: Styling Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a styling solution that provides:
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Responsive design capabilities
- Consistent design system
- Small production bundle size
- Good developer experience
- Easy customization and theming

## Decision
We will use **Tailwind CSS 3.4.14** as our primary styling framework.

### Key Dependencies:
- `tailwindcss@3.4.14` - Utility-first CSS framework
- `postcss@8.4.49` - CSS processing tool
- `autoprefixer@10.4.20` - Automatic vendor prefixing
- `@tailwindcss/typography` - Typography plugin (if needed)

## Alternatives Considered
1. **CSS Modules** - Good isolation but verbose for utility patterns
2. **Styled Components** - Runtime overhead and SSR complexity
3. **Emotion** - Similar issues to styled-components
4. **Bootstrap** - Too opinionated and larger bundle size
5. **Chakra UI** - Good component library but less flexible

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Rapid prototyping with utility classes
- Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Excellent responsive design utilities
- Tree-shaking removes unused styles
- No runtime overhead (pure CSS)
- Great developer experience with IntelliSense
- Easy to maintain and customize
- Small production bundle size

### Negative:
- Learning curve for utility-first approach
- HTML can become verbose with many classes
- Requires build step for optimization
- Less semantic CSS class names

### Technical Impact:
- Enables rapid UI development
- Consistent design system across components
- Optimized CSS bundle through purging
- Easy responsive design implementation
- Reduced CSS maintenance overhead
