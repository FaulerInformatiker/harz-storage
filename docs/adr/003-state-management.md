# ADR-003: State Management Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need state management for:
- Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- Language switching (German/English)
- Form state management
- API data caching
- User preferences persistence

The application is relatively simple and doesn't require complex state management.

## Decision
We will use **React Context API** for global state management with localStorage persistence.

### Key Dependencies:
- React built-in Context API
- `localStorage` for persistence
- Custom hooks for state management

### Implementation:
- `TranslationContext` - Language state and translations
- `ThemeContext` - Theme preferences
- Local component state for forms and UI interactions

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Redux Toolkit** - Overkill for simple state needs
2. **Zustand** - Good but unnecessary for our use case
3. **Jotai** - Atomic approach but adds complexity
4. **SWR/React Query** - Good for API state but we need simple caching
5. **Local State Only** - Insufficient for cross-component state

## Consequences

### Positive:
- No additional dependencies
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- Built into React ecosystem
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Automatic re-rendering optimization
- localStorage integration for persistence
- Type-safe with TypeScript

### Negative:
- Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not optimized
- No built-in devtools
- Manual optimization required for performance
- Limited scalability for complex state

### Technical Impact:
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Easy testing with React Testing Library
- Simple state persistence
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to migrate to more complex solutions if needed
