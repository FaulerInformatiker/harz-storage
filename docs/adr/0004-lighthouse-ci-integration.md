# ADR-0004: Lighthouse CI Integration for Performance Testing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The HarzStorage website needs continuous performance monitoring to ensure optimal user experience and maintain high web standards. Manual performance testing is time-consuming and inconsistent, leading to potential performance regressions going unnoticed.

## Decision
We will integrate Lighthouse CI into our continuous integration pipeline to automatically test performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO on every pull request and push to main.

## Implementation Details
- **Tool**: @lhci/cli (Lighthouse CI)
- **Configuration**: lighthouserc.js with strict thresholds
- **Performance Standards**:
  - Performance: ≥80% (Warning threshold)
  - Accessibility: ≥90% (Error threshold)
  - Best Practices: ≥80% (Warning threshold)
  - SEO: ≥90% (Error threshold)
- **Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow
- **Reporting**: Public temporary storage for performance reports

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automated performance regression detection
- Consistent performance standards enforcement
- Improved user experience through performance monitoring
- SEO and accessibility compliance validation
- Performance metrics tracking over time

### Negative
- Additional CI pipeline execution time (~2-3 minutes)
- Potential false positives requiring threshold adjustments
- Dependency on external Lighthouse service availability

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual Performance Testing**: Rejected due to inconsistency and time requirements
2. **WebPageTest Integration**: Rejected due to complexity and cost
3. **Custom Performance Scripts**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

## Implementation
- Added `@lhci/cli` dependency
- Created `lighthouserc.js` configuration
- Added GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`
- Updated documentation and project rules
- Added to required status checks for branch protection
