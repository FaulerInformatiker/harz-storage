# ADR-006: Containerization and Deployment

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a deployment strategy that provides:
- Consistent environments across development, staging, and production
- Scalability and reliability
- Security best practices
- Easy rollbacks and updates
- Infrastructure as code
- Container orchestration capabilities

## Decision
We will use **Docker containerization** with **Kubernetes deployment** using Helm charts.

### Key Technologies:
- **Docker** - Container runtime and image building
- **Alpine Linux** - Minimal, secure base image
- **Node.js 22.11-alpine** - Runtime environment
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Helm** - Kubernetes package manager
- **Multi-stage builds** - Optimized image size

### Key Dependencies:
- `node:22.11-alpine` - Base runtime image
- Kubernetes cluster (any provider)
- Helm 3.x for deployment management

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Serverless (Vercel/Netlify)** - Limited control and vendor lock-in
2. **Traditional VMs** - Higher overhead and maintenance
3. **Docker Compose only** - Limited scalability
4. **Bare metal deployment** - Complex maintenance
5. **Platform-as-a-Service** - Less flexibility and higher costs

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Consistent environments across all stages
- Easy horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
- Immutable deployments reduce configuration drift
- Built-in health checks and self-healing
- Easy rollbacks with Helm
- Security scanning integrated into build process
- Infrastructure as code with Helm charts
- Multi-cloud portability

### Negative:
- Additional complexity in setup and maintenance
- Kubernetes learning curve for team
- Resource overhead of container orchestration
- More complex debugging in containerized environments
- Additional security considerations for container images

### Technical Impact:
- Dockerfile optimized with multi-stage builds
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks for reliability
- Resource limits and requests defined
- Automated security scanning with Trivy
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Helm charts for configuration management

### Container Security:
- Non-root user (nextjs:nodejs)
- Minimal Alpine base image
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Resource constraints to prevent abuse

### Deployment Architecture:
```
