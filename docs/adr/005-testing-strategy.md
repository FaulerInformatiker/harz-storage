# ADR-005: Testing Strategy and Tools

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need comprehensive testing coverage for:
- React components and hooks
- API routes and business logic
- End-to-end user workflows
- Security and accessibility
- Contract testing for external APIs
- High code coverage requirements (90%+)

## Decision
We will implement a **multi-layered testing strategy** with specialized tools for each layer.

### Testing Stack:
- **Unit/Integration**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **End-to-End**: Playwright
- **Contract Testing**: Pact
- **Security Testing**: Custom validation tests
- **API Testing**: Supertest-style testing for Next.js API routes

### Key Dependencies:
- `jest@29.7.0` - Test runner and framework
- `@testing-library/react@16.0.1` - React component testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom@6.6.3` - DOM matchers
- `playwright@1.48.2` - E2E testing
- `@pact-foundation/pact@15.0.1` - Contract testing

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Vitest** - Faster but less mature ecosystem
2. **Cypress** - Good E2E but Playwright has better features
3. **Testing Library alone** - Insufficient for E2E scenarios
4. **No contract testing** - Risk of API integration issues

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Comprehensive test coverage across all layers
- Fast feedback loop with unit tests
- Realistic E2E testing with Playwright
- API contract validation prevents integration issues
- Security testing catches vulnerabilities early
- Great developer experience with React Testing Library
- Parallel test execution for speed
- Clear separation of test types

### Negative:
- Complex test setup and maintenance
- Multiple tools to learn and maintain
- Longer CI/CD pipeline execution time
- Higher maintenance overhead
- Potential test flakiness in E2E tests

### Technical Impact:
- 90%+ code coverage requirement enforced
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Pre-commit hooks prevent broken code
- Contract tests ensure API compatibility
- Security tests validate input handling
- E2E tests protect critical user journeys

### Test Structure:
```
tests/
├── e2e/                 # Playwright E2E tests
├── contract/            # Pact contract tests
└── security/            # Security validation tests

app/__tests__/           # Jest unit tests
components/__tests__/    # Component tests
lib/__tests__/          # Utility function tests
```

### Coverage Requirements:
- Branches: 90%
- Functions: 90%
- Lines: 90%
- Statements: 90%
